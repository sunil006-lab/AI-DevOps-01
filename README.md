# AI-DevOps-01 - Python based Intelligent Disaster recovery Automation using Agentic AI and Terraform
Description: 
This python based project focuses on building an intelligent, fully automated Disaster Recovery (DR) framework by integrating Agentic AI with Terraform. The AI
layer continuously monitors infrastrucutre, evaluates system health, and predicts potential failures or SLA breaches. Based on defined conditions, it autonomously triggers Terraform workflows to provision or failover cloud resources with minimal manual intervention. This ensures high availability, cost efficiency, and resilience while reducing human error in DR operations.
